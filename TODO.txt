     using dotted forms for the w-series.
   + Use ᑊ 'West-Cree P'.
   + Use * (asterisk, borrowed from linguist's marking of a word that is not
     correctly formed) -- but this is less easy to write with a pen.
   + Use ᐤ 'final ring'
** TODO Use .woff(2?) instead of .tty fonts

   + Syllabics should have same line thickness in raised symbols as in other
     symbols.
   + Overdot should be centered above the dotted circle symbol.

   + "Tutorial: Choosing the right fonts to show Cree syllabics on your website"
     [https://blog.mothertongues.org/tutorial-syllabics-fonts/]
   + "Google Noto Fonts"
     [https://www.google.com/get/noto/]

   After playing around with fonts and discovering that next to no fonts
   actually have support for Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, I googled the
   problem and found the "Choosing the right font to show Cree syllabics"
   above.

   This led me to "Noto Sans" which is the only font I've been able to find
   which have the same line thickness for raised symbols as for the other ones.
   For the Latin alphabet I tried "Noto Serif", but the serifs look inane and
   unwieldy so a decided to use "Noto Sans" for all text.

   BUUT it turns out that the placement of the overdot is not centered above
   the dotted circle in "Noto Sans Symbols", so I instead went with Times New
   Roman from Windows 10 (which fixes this, and also have an overdot which have
   about the same size and shape as the overdots in the syllabics in "Noto Sans
   Canadian Aboriginal").

   In the end, "Noto Sans" is used for all Latin characters, using "Noto Sans
   Canadian Aboriginal" as a fallback to handle all syllabics symbols, and
   "Times" as an additional fallback to handle symbols (like the overdot, and
   dotted circle).
