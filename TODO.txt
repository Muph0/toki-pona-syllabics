   + Syllabics should have same line thickness in raised symbols as in other
     symbols.
   + Overdot should be centered above the dotted circle symbol.

   + "Tutorial: Choosing the right fonts to show Cree syllabics on your website"
     [https://blog.mothertongues.org/tutorial-syllabics-fonts/]
   + "Google Noto Fonts"
     [https://www.google.com/get/noto/]

   After playing around with fonts and discovering that next to no fonts
   actually have support for Canadian Aboriginal syllabics, I googled the
   problem and found the "Choosing the right font to show Cree syllabics"
   above.

   This led me to "Noto Sans" which is the only font I've been able to find
   which have the same line thickness for raised symbols as for the other ones.
   For the Latin alphabet I tried "Noto Serif", but the serifs look inane and
   unwieldy so a decided to use "Noto Sans" for all text.

   BUUT it turns out that the placement of the overdot is not centered above
   the dotted circle in "Noto Sans Symbols", so I instead went with Times New
   Roman from Windows 10 (which fixes this, and also have an overdot which have
   about the same size and shape as the overdots in the syllabics in "Noto Sans
   Canadian Aboriginal").

   In the end, "Noto Sans" is used for all Latin characters, using "Noto Sans
   Canadian Aboriginal" as a fallback to handle all syllabics symbols, and
   "Times" as an additional fallback to handle symbols (like the overdot, and
   dotted circle).
** DONE Add marking for names (Shavian 'namer dot'?)
   CLOSED: [2021-03-20 Sat 17:15]
   + Use ·êß 'final middle dot' (inspired by Shavian) -- if so, this requires not
     using dotted forms for the w-series.
   + Use ·ëä 'West-Cree P'.
   + Use * (asterisk, borrowed from linguist's marking of a word that is not
     correctly formed) -- but this is less easy to write with a pen.

   I am working out a new writing system for toki pona called "sitelen lili",
   and I'm already working on a font for it, but that might take a while. It
   basically a syllabic system, consonant (or "blank character" if there's no
   consonant) is read first than the vowel above it, has multiple forms for
   each letter (for stylistic use or differentiating/emphasizing), has its own
   punctuation and o-u difference is optional. The long text is the first verse
   of "olin li tawa jan ale".

   Interesting. I like its efficiency in terms of strokes.

   A couple of questions. What made you decide to design the alternative forms?
   And the o/u optional merger? These seem to add a bit of complexity that I'm
   not sure is necessary.

   I wonder whether there's another stage you could push this to, where the
   alternate forms have usage patterns that make ergonomic sense, like the
   tilde-like n is used after a horizontal stroke to differentiate it, whilst
   the rounded forms of w and m might be used when sequences of your various
   'v' / 'L' shapes get a bit tricky to distinguish.

   Have you tried designing cursive forms for these? The angles are perhaps a
   bit confusing. Maybe look to Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and/or Thaana
   and/or shorthand systems for some ideas about creating a flowing, yet
   distinguishable style with a bunch of pretty similar letter forms.

   Hope you don't mind my honest thoughts, fundamentally you've got a lot of
   good material there but if it were a script in real life I think it would
   naturally develop a bit past this point for elegance and ease üôÇ

   Robin Morton: I can hazard a guess at the o/u merger. I discovered long ago
   that if you merge o and u, you don‚Äôt get any accidental homophones. The only
   consonant affected is < j >, And then only if you change o to u rather than
   u to o. So Toki Pona can function with a four vowel system rather than a
   five vowel system.

   Robin Morton if there wasn't kin and ken, even i and e coupd be merged. as
   Marcus said, there are no words where only o-u differes, so it's possible
   (and I haven't had a good idea for 'u')

** DONE jan Pije: Javascript, put naming mark on Capitalized Words
   CLOSED: [2021-03-25 Thu 15:14]
   For a word to be capitalized it must start with a capital letter, if it
   thereafter ends (being only one letter long), or contain at least one lower
   case letter then it is counted as a Capitalized Word. If the word is FULLY
   CAPITALIZED it will not get a naming mark, but if it is Boaty McBoatface it
   will. All words capitalized thusly get a naming mark (even if there are more
   than one after each other).
